## Problem

__[collections.Counter()](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter)__  
 A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.
 
 <sub> __Sample Code__ </sub>
 
    >>> from collections import Counter
    >>> 
    >>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
    >>> print Counter(myList)
    Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
    >>>
    >>> print Counter(myList).items()
    [(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
    >>> 
    >>> print Counter(myList).keys()
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> 
    >>> print Counter(myList).values()
    [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]

The next $N$ lines contain the space separated values of the $shoe \ size$ desired by the customer and $x_i$, the price of the shoe.

__Constraints__

$0 < X < 10^3$  
$0 < N \le 10^3$  
$20 < x_i < 100$  
$ 2 < shoe \ size < 20 $

    TotalItems=int(input())
    L=list(map(int,input().split(" ")))
    dict=Counter(L)
    Sale= int(input())
    totalAmount=0
    for i in range(Sale) :
        k=list(map(int,input().split(" ")))
        if k[0] in dict.keys():
            if dict[k[0]]>0:
                dict[k[0]]=dict[k[0]]-1
                totalAmount=totalAmount+k[1]
